I might be a bit disappointed. Not really angry. Because, in some weird way, it makes sense.

What I'm talking about is the handling of mime in JS/ECMAscript/browser.

I understand that TC39 are hard at work bringing web to everyone but some decisions are just baffeling.

All around, the APIs proposed are fine, but sometimes I think they might have missed the mark.

Let's take for example:


## The History of <code>mime</code> types

> If you know what `mime type` means, feel free to skip this section.

Initially every file was just that - a file. A chunk of bytes on a drive.
It might have been a text document or a compiled binary or
a databse chunk - you would not know. How would you differentiate between a `plaintext` file
containing human readable text and machine instructions? You wouldn't.

When you would open *a* file, you could have opened a machine-code binary or a human readable text file.
For our programming forfathers there would be little difference. But along the way, there came a need
to set apart code that was human-readable and code that was machine-like, escpecially with the advent of
high-level languages like C.

Alas, other people than programmers started using computers, so the need to distinguish between
human-readable documents and binaries (machine-readable documents) increased.

Many of early programmers simply assumed that a file is not human readable when the first
few bytes are not human readable. This gave birth to differentionaton by `magic` numbers.

If a file started with a few select bytes, for example `7f 45 4c 46`, that meant
that the file was special and was not meant to be viewed by humans but by machines.

Some of our programming forfathers stared to use `file extensions` as the differentionator - just name
the file whatever, bang a dot `.` at the end and when the value after the dot means that
it is human-readable of machine-readable.

```
| the name of the file |
  |▼|
 file.ext
      |▲|
      |extension|
```
TODO: Finish the thought
Bacause of course there would be no need to make the filename longer than 8 chars and 3 chars for extension.


## The <code>essence</code> of Clipboard API

An `essence` is a fancy word for an assumed mime type on the web. I understand that many platfroms
might not be able to determine the proper mime type, but then to require proper mimes to be
present is a whole other question (styles being loaded as `text/css`, wasm as `application/wasm`);

For example, <abbr title="what the frick">WTF</abbr> is a `os specific well-known format`?

As per [W3](https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/#to-os-specific-well-known-format) it is an algorithm
that takes in \[sic\]
- <i>mimeType</i>

and returns \[sic\]
- <i>wellKnownFormat</i>, a platform specific string type.
    On Mac it's NSPasteboardType, on Windows it's LPCWSTR and Linux it's a const char*.

The algo definition is \[sic, improved for readability\]\(\):

```
Let wellKnownFormat be a string.
- If mimeType's essence is "text/plain", then
    On Windows, follow the convention described below:
    Assign CF_UNICODETEXT to wellKnownFormat.
    Return wellKnownFormat.

    On MacOS, follow the convention described below:
    Assign NSPasteboardTypeString to wellKnownFormat.
    Return wellKnownFormat.

    On Linux, ChromeOS, and Android, follow the convention described below:
    Assign "text/plain" to wellKnownFormat.
    Return wellKnownFormat.

- Else, if mimeType's essence is "text/html", then
    On Windows, follow the convention described below:
    Assign CF_HTML to wellKnownFormat.
    Return wellKnownFormat.

    On MacOS, follow the convention described below:
    Assign NSHTMLPboardType to wellKnownFormat.
    Return wellKnownFormat.

    On Linux, ChromeOS, and Android, follow the convention described below:
    Assign "text/html" to wellKnownFormat.
    Return wellKnownFormat.

- Else, if mimeType's essence is "image/png", then
    On Windows, follow the convention described below:
    Assign "PNG" to wellKnownFormat.
    Return wellKnownFormat.

    On MacOS, follow the convention described below:
    Assign NSPasteboardTypePNG to wellKnownFormat.
    Return wellKnownFormat.

    On Linux, ChromeOS, and Android, follow the convention described below:
    Assign "image/png" to wellKnownFormat.
    Return wellKnownFormat.

- Else
    This is left to the implementation...
```

Simplified, OKey, so when the text is not explicitly `text/html`
- On `Windows` the format is `CF_UNICODETEXT`
- On `MacOs` the format is `NSPasteboardTypeString`
- On `POSIXlike` the format is `text/plain`
- On `elsewhere` the format is `whateverthefuck/youwant`

This seems like a good enought assumtion. But what if I passed a **raw binary** as `text/plain`?

```sh
$ echo -n -e '\x13\x37' > data.bin
$ xxd data.bin
00000000: 1337                                     .7
$ xclip -sel c < ./data.bin
```

Now I have a string of weird binary chars `0x13 0x37` in my clipboard. This is verified with `-o` flag:
```sh
$ xclip -o -sel c | xxd
00000000: 1337                                     .7
```

Since there is no mime data associated with `13 37`, the browser _assumes_ that the mime is `text/plain` as per
the `well known format`. Upon making a dumb HTML template:
```
<!doctype html><html><body><input type="text"></body></html>
```

Displaying and pasting results in:

import chrome_paste_input from './chrome-paste-input.png';
import firefox_paste_input from './firefox-paste-input.png';

`Google Chrome 123.0.6312.105 @ linux 6.5.0-44 x86_64`:
<Image src={chrome_paste_input} alt="Chrome display"/>

`Mozilla Firefox 129.0.2 @ linux 6.5.0-44 x86_64`:
<Image src={firefox_paste_input} alt="Firefox display"/>

So it seems that pasting of raw bytes is actually handled reasonably fine. I sadly have no machines running Windows or MacOS
to check the results against as per the spec.

Still there are a lot of issues coming, not only for binaries

But there is another problem, creeping in the background -

### `edian`ness

### <code>base64</code> is solved, right...?
