I've recently got an urge to play GTA:Vice City again. Maybe to just cruise along
and rock out to the best soundtrack ever or to try some speedrun strats.

I've heard of the reimplementation of Vice City by the GTA Modding community and
was impressed by their efforts to bring such an old game on any device.

Sadly, Take Two issued a [DMCA complaint](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2021/02/2021-02-19-take-two.md)
against their public codebase. No matter,
I had my own clone of the repo and plenty of people were still hosting their
"presumably illegal" clones.

The main repository is still under [DMCA takedown](https://github.com/GTAmodding/re3),
but since when you post something on the internet it's there forever,
the Internet Archive snagged a copy just before takedown and it's available at
[The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/github.com-GTAmodding-re3_-_2021-09-06_14-11-00);

Since taking on T2 lawyers would be a lengthy, costly (and probably stupid TBH) undertaking I undestand
that contesting this takedown is outside of the possibilites of the people that worked hard on such
a monumental task.

I firmly stand behind the idea that reverse engineering is a right and as long as you don't profit as
a competitior against the original authors, you hsould be allowed to go anything you please
with the software or devices you paid for.

The law is pretty sketchy around these parts, so I would recommend you to read
- [EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) FAQ about reversing](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq)
- [vidstromlabs summary about reversing in the EU](https://www.vidstromlabs.com/blog/the-legal-boundaries-of-reverse-engineering-in-the-eu/)

Since I've cracked a few pieces of software myself I know that reversing is an art and
should be respected, not prosecuted.


The Definitive Edition
----------------------

Not long after, T2 announced the [Trilofy Definitive Edition](https://www.rockstargames.com/GTATrilogy). Plenty of people were
understandably excited. Not me, really, because I knew they would include some bullshit DRM that won't work without ring 0 access
on windows.

But oh boy, noone was ready for the shit they would put out.

Grove Street Games, clearly understaffed, overworked and feature-crept
were forced to put out a clearly mangled version. Some (not all) issues are beatufily and clearly
demonstrated in a 2-parter by Vadim M narrated by BadgerGoodger.

- [Part 1 (31 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSvoC6lZl5s&ab_channel=VadimM)
- [Part 2 (42 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTxY_S0XD8E&ab_channel=VadimM)

R* [apologised](https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/393o373751k48k/a-note-from-the-rockstar-games-team-re-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-th)
and promised to fix the most glaring issues. To be fair, some were fixed, but pushing 4 patches in nearly 2 years and never fixing
keybinding issues is a clear sign of... ignorance? Incompetence? Carelessness?

The technical aspect of the remasters is interesting and clearly a product of poeple that care and have plenty of know
how and balls to run two game engines in parallel and use AI for texture upscaling
[(source, couldn't find the original)](https://libertycity.net/gta-the-trilogy/news/5168-gta-the-trilogy-combines-unreal-engine.html).

Thus, IMHO, the blame in on T2 for pushing out unfinished software, not on Grove Street Games for trying
to implement three huge games at once. But since it looks like that T2 and R* aren't spending any of
the gambling GTA 5 online money on continued development of Definitive Edition, it seems that we won't get another
No Man's Sky story.


Skip the Story, Let's Compile
-----------------------------

OK, let's get the archive.

```
$ take re3-miami
$ wget https://archive.org/download/github.com-GTAmodding-re3_-_2021-09-06_14-11-00/GTAmodding-re3_-_2021-09-06_14-11-00.bundle
$ file GTAmodding-re3_-_2021-09-06_14-11-00.bundle
GTAmodding-re3_-_2021-09-06_14-11-00.bundle: Git bundle
```

It's a git bundle, so let's clone it into our own repo.

```
$ git clone GTAmodding-re3_-_2021-09-06_14-11-00.bundle re3
$ cd re3
$ git log --oneline | head -5
3233ffe1 Merge pull request #1233 from madebr/cmake-fixes
3569b7ed Fix ped comments on oal
a15d5589 Fix reflection counter
d23c045d Audio: small refactoring
3bc6aa85 Audio: a bit more PS2 changes
```

Comparing to other mirrors, the merge of PR#1233 is indeed the last commit.

Next, let's checkout the `miami` branch. This will require for us to pull refs from remote/bundle.

```
$ git checkout miami
error: pathspec 'miami' did not match any file(s) known to git
$ git fetch -u ../GTAmodding-re3_-_2021-09-06_14-11-00.bundle 'refs/*:refs/*'
From ../GTAmodding-re3_-_2021-09-06_14-11-00.bundle
 * [new ref]           origin/miami -> origin/miami
 * [new ref]           origin/lcs   -> origin/lcs
$ git checkout miami
Branch 'miami' set up to track remote branch 'miami' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'miami'
```

We could also checkout `origin/miami` but doesn't really matter.

We got `CMakeLists.txt` and `premake`, I'm used to `cmake` and I already have it installed.

```
$ cmake ..
-- Building reVC GIT SHA1: a16fcd8d6a79e433c1c6e73d540f1bbe27e14164
-- REVC_AUDIO = OAL (choices=OAL)

  may not contain '/'.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  src/CMakeLists.txt:56 (find_package)


-- Checking for one of the modules 'mpg123'
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
```

Oh, so we will need to get some headers and libs on our system. We could of course download and install them separately,
but since I'm lazy and Ubuntu provides a lot of packages, I will install the prerequisites using `apt`.

You can get the prerequisites from sources, compile, link and provide headers for cmake yourselves.

Ubuntu development packages are usually in the format of `lib[NAME]-dev`. After installing one, I try to run
`cmake` again and again until all libraries are available.

For me the missing libraries were `openal`, `glfw3` and `mpg132`, you might need more.
Probably `opengl` I would hazard a guess.

```
$ sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev libglfw3-dev libmpg132-dev
[ --- normal apt-get output, nothing interesting --- ]
```

After running `cmake` again:

```
$ take build
$ cmake ..
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 9.4.0
[ --- lines ommited ---]
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:45 (add_subdirectory):

[ --- lines ommited ---]
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
```

We will need to get `librw` which is a OSS reimplementation of the RenderWare engine.
Fortunately the source is added as a git module, so we just need to fetch the modules.

```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

```

Let's try `cmake` again.

```
$ cmake ..
-- Building reVC GIT SHA1: a16fcd8d6a79e433c1c6e73d540f1bbe27e14164

-- Checking for one of the modules 'mpg123'
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /somrlik/projects/re3-miami/re3/build
```

Nice, let's `make`!

```
$ make
[ --- a lot of warnings --- ]

make: *** [Makefile:91: all] Error 2
```

This is a bit harder to debug, so I will spare you the process.

When `librw` is compiled with `LIBRW_PLATFORM = NULL`, `RWDEVICE` is not defined, since there is
no rendering device. From `cmake` output, we can see that the possible values are `NULL,GL3`

```
-- LIBRW_PLATFORM = NULL (choices=NULL;GL3)
```

presuming `GL3` stands for `OpenGL 3` we can regenerate makefiles by passing the option to `cmake`

```
$ cmake -DLIBRW_PLATFORM=GL3 ..
-- Building reVC GIT SHA1: a16fcd8d6a79e433c1c6e73d540f1bbe27e14164

-- Checking for one of the modules 'mpg123'

```

Okay, let's `make`!

Well, the executable runs, but segfaults. Seems we're missing the original files, so let's just copy
the executable in the root of our original Vice City install. I'm using the Steam release.

> There is no `install` target in the generated Makefile (in fact, there is just one target)
> so I will be copying everything by hand.

```
$ cp ./reVC ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Grand\ Theft\ Auto\ Vice\ City/reVC
$ ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Grand\ Theft\ Auto\ Vice\ City/reVC
[ --- the same as above --- ]
[1]    1103206 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Grand\ Theft\ Auto\ Vice\ City/reVC
```

After some digging around in the repo, I found the missing files in `gamefiles` directory in root of repo,
so I just copied them.

```
$ cp -R ../../gamefiles/* ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Grand\ Theft\ Auto\ Vice\ City
$ ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Grand\ Theft\ Auto\ Vice\ City/reVC
[ --- the same as above --- ]
[1]    1103206 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Grand\ Theft\ Auto\ Vice\ City/reVC
```

After some more digging, I found out that CWD matters for `reVC`. Writing a patch for this probably wouldn't be hard.
But sure, let's run it "properly".

```
$ cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Grand\ Theft\ Auto\ Vice\ City
$ ./reVC
```

Violá.


Maybe We Are Done

```

you are as stumped as I was.

After some debugging, I found [this glfw commit](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/commit/9372ba95faabd1bb45280d201d6ccdae77bf872e) that
presumably fixes this issue. Okay, the version supplied by canonical probably predates this commit and updating GLFW
in my system to another version and potentionally breaking other packages is not something I want to do.

TBH, I don't know if it is just me, but I've always had issues when using GLFW. But I've had success using SDL!

Luckily, `librw` allows you to choose the frontend (backend?) for the OpenGL rendering and the choices are GLFW and SDL2!

So, let's get SDL2

```
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
$ cmake -DLIBRW_PLATFORM=GL3 -DLIBRW_GL3_GFXLIB=SDL2 ..
$ make -j12
[ --- compiler output --- ]
/somrlik/projects/re3-miami/re3/src/skel/crossplatform.h:66:5: error: ‘GLFWwindow’ does not name a type
   66 |     GLFWwindow* window;
[ --- compiler output --- ]
make: *** [Makefile:91: all] Error 2
```

Oh, so `librw` can use SDL2 but `re3` requires GLFW.

So, GLFW it is then.

Like I said, I won't be updating the system-wide GLFW, so I chose to build the newest release of GLFW3 from source.

> For those interested, the [issue](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1633) might be related to running a tiling window manager
> with no window decorations, but I tested both with and without window decorations and in my case
> compiling with or without commit `fe57e3c` doesn't make a difference.

So let's visit [releases]() and see that the latest version is `3.3.8`. My system has `3.3.2` installed, which I found out by
adding

```
printf("GLFW version: %s\n", glfwGetVersionString());
```

to `/vendor/librw/src/gl/gl3device.cpp` and recompiling.
This seemed like the simplest way, since I already had everything open.

Since it's a vendor lib, let's add it to `vendor`:

> I could have also added it as another git module, but dealing with git modules is IMO a bit of a hassle.

```
$ TEMPFILE=$(mktemp)
$ wget -qO "${TEMPFILE}" https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases/download/3.3.8/glfw-3.3.8.zip
$ unzip -u -d ./vendor/ "${TEMPFILE}"
$ rm "${TEMPFILE}"
```

Since I won't be installing GLFW system wide, I chose a different install prefix, `./pfx` for simplicity,

```
$ cd ./vendor/glfw-3.3.8
$ take build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./pfx ..
$ make
$ make install
```

Oh, GLFW compiles some tests to the `tests` folder by default. Let's try them!

```
$ ./tests/glfwinfo
GLFW header version: 3.3.8
GLFW library version: 3.3.8
GLFW library version string: "3.3.8 X11 GLX EGL OSMesa clock_gettime evdev"
[--- more info about OpenGL and Vulkan ---]
$ ./tests/windows
```

The last one even opens a window! And it works!

> Compiling 3.3.2 and trying to run `./tests/windows` works but `./tests/inputlag` fails
> with the same error as above. No clue what is really happening.

Let's `make install` and see what is included in out installation.

```
$ make install
$ tree pfx
pfx
├── include
│   └── GLFW
│       ├── glfw3.h
│       └── glfw3native.h

        └── glfw3.pc

6 directories, 8 files
```

We have the `lib/pkgconfig/glfw3.pc` that will tell `cmake` where to find our version of GLFW,
so we're golden.

Let's just point `cmake` to our GLFW installation and compile `re3` again.

```
$ cd ../../../build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=../vendor/glfw-3.3.8/build/pfx -DLIBRW_PLATFORM=GL3 -DLIBRW_GL3_GFXLIB=GLFW ..
$ time make -j$(nproc)

[100%] Built target reVC
make -j$(nproc)  91,80s user 10,10s system 991% cpu 10,272 total
```

Copying the files over and running `./reVC` the screen blinks and

Done
----

<Image alt="Screenshot of Vice City with debugging info from re3" src={vcDebug} />

And we're done. I hope you didn't encounter my issues with GLFW and you have a copy of `reVC`
running on your machine.

Be sure to thank everyone who contributed to the original code.

Have fun hacking around the code and maybe I will try to write some mods myself too.
