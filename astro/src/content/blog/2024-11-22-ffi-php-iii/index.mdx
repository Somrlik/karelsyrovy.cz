ABIs (Application Binary Interface) are a lot like APIs (Application Programming Interface).
You might even consider ABI an API, since they describe the programming interface on a binary level.

So far I've been compiling both `PHP` and `libmeddle` with the same version of compiler
on the same system - that means that the holy trinity has been the same:
- The architecture - `x86_64`
- The operating system - `GNU/Linux`
- The compiler - `GCC 11.4.0`

Why does all of this matter? Well, what would happen if I compiled `libmeddle` under a different system, let's say
- The architecture - `aarm64`
- The OS - `Windows NT 10.0` (yes, Windows 11 still has NT version of 10.0)
- The compiler - `MSVC 17.10.1`

what exactly would change?

### Aside About Windows

> You can skip this.

I didn't actually compile `libmeddle` under Windows. But I honestly *tried*.

Microsoft provides [prebuild VMs for development](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/),
that come with a lot of the goodies - for starters, it's the `Enterprise` edition (whatever that means),
`Visual Studio 2022` with `MSVC 17.10.1` prepackaged, `WSL 2`, `Windows Terminal` (whatever that is) and
even the developer mode is enabled! You just need to re-download it when the license expires. Seems great.

```
> Is it possible to get an ARM version of the VM?

Unfortunately, we don't have an ARM version available at the moment. We understand that this
may be disappointing news, but we don't have any short term plans to create these. However, we're always
open to feedback and suggestions from our users and will take them into consideration when planning future updates.
```

Okay, so no `aarm64` for me. I don't even have any machines ATM, was planning to make someone
owning one run the tests.

The image is whopping **22.1 GB**, and upon running its god awful slow and asks me to activate `Cortana`,
login to my Microsoft account when running `Visual Studio` and installs fucking `Candy Crush`.

I deleted it.

The `microsoft/windows` [images on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windows) aren't even desktop Windows,
they're some kind of `Windows Server Container` which can only run on Windows 10 Enterprise or whatever.

Needless to say I don't think I will be compiling *anything* under Windows for a long time.


## A Lot

First of all, I will get a `.dll` instead of `.so`. Windows has a different "syscall" than `dlopen()`, `LoadLibrary()`
from what I can gather from the docs. Shouldn't be an issue. Right?

I "compiled" (not really, see above) `libmeddle.dll` under `MSVC`, thus its full "holy triplet" is [^1] :

```
x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
 ^^^^   ^^^^^^^^   ^^
 arch     os      compiler
```

But I was forced to compile PHP using `MingW` (since `MSVC` is not a supported compiler for `PHP > like 5`), thus
it's "triplet" is [^2] :

```
x86_64-w64-mingw32
```

So is `libmeddle.dll` compiled under `MSVC` compatible with `PHP` [^3] compiled under `Mingw`? They both have a
couple of choices to make, for example:
- if the headers say `long`, is it 4 bytes or 8 bytes? Or *6* bytes?
- if the headers say `int`, is it 4 bytes `little endian` or `big endian`? Or is it 4 bytes?
- if I have `struct {char a; char b; char c;}`, do I align it to 4 bytes for some magic memory
  optimization or keep it as 3 bytes wide?
- do I represent `double` as `IEEE 754` values or just use my own floating-point representation?

Tell us, tell us, I hear you pleading, are they actually compatible?

Well, *maybe*.


## GCC and Clang

Since I wasn't able to test compiling under Windows (see rant above), I decided on a simpler and more tool-supported
dilemma: `GCC` vs. `Clang` (under linux).

Compiling Clang using GCC feels a bit funny. Like when you use an old compiler to build the new one.
Like shooting and old dog just to get a new one. Morbid.

I would compile `libmeddle` under `GCC 11.4.0` and `CLang@0efa38699` and get two very similar looking, albeit not the same
"triplets":
```
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
x86_64-pc-linux-clang
```

Just for fun, I also added `abi_interop.h` which contains:

```c
__int128_t returnsLooongInt(__int128_t);
```

`int128` or `bigint` (or whatever you might call it) which is famous for being the odd-one-out on many platforms.

Using a beautiful piece of software called `abi-complience-checker` [GitHub](https://lvc.github.io/abi-compliance-checker/)
I can then verify that both versions of `libmeddle` have the same ABI:
```stdout
$ ./compare-abi.sh
$ abi-dumper libmeddle-gcc.so -o ABI-0.dump -lver 0
Reading debug-info
Creating ABI dump

The object ABI has been dumped to:
  ABI-0.dump

$ abi-dumper libmeddle-clang.so -o ABI-1.dump -lver 1
abi-dumper libmeddle-clang.so -o ABI-1.dump -lver 1
Reading debug-info
Creating ABI dump

The object ABI has been dumped to:
  ABI-1.dump

$ abi-compliance-checker -l libmeddle -old ABI-0.dump -new ABI-1.dump
Preparing, please wait ...

Source compatibility: 100%
Total binary compatibility problems: 0, warnings: 1
Total source compatibility problems: 0, warnings: 1
Report: compat_reports/libmeddle/0_to_1/compat_report.html
```

We got an `.html` report!

Now this is what I call `perl` magic (both `abi-dumper` and `abi-compliance-checker` are written in perl), let's see it:

It seems like the ABI is the same! Even for `abi_interop.c` which has `__int128_t` type!

So far `libmeddle`'s ABI is the same between compilers - because the compilers `chose to do so`.

Compatibility between `gcc` and `clang` ABIs is (at least on linux for C) superb. You can see a
bit of a ruckus here and there, but as far as I see, both compilers use compatible ABIs.

A small side-note for C++: since `libffi` is incompatible with... basically any C++ ABI,
I will not continue in trying to make C++ interface work for this project [^4] . At least using `libffi`.

`cmake` made sure that some ABI is present - let's study the output of `cmake`:

```stdout
$ CC=clang CXX=c++ cmake -S . -B build
-- The C compiler identification is Clang 20.0.0
-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 11.4.0
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done
-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc - skipped
-- Detecting C compile features
-- Detecting C compile features - done
-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info
-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ - skipped
[...a lot more checks...]
```

Side-note: Using different compilers for C and C++ might seem like a weird thing to do,
but isn't that uncommon (citation actually needed, I did it several times in uni when testing
c code using c++, dunno if it actually happens IRL).

If `cmake` met a compiler which did not emit ABI info, it would fail (as was the case of [Zig compiler](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20493)).
It does not check that ABIs are the same, because it has nothing to check against. It just checks
that *some* ABI is emitted.


## When ABI **Is** Different

Let's illustrate what might happen if I were a software vendor and provided you with a piece of software
(let's call it `decrypt`) that was:
- build for `x86_64` for simplicityâ€™s sake
- compiled using my own compiler (let's call it `bestc` because it of course would be best)
- dynamically linked to system `libssl` which I of course compiled with `bestc`

My `bestc` compiler would of course implement its own ABIs, since it's the best and thus don't need
to be chained by standards.

You would run my `decrypt` binary - it would dynamically link against *yours* `libssl`.

Since my system version of `libssl`'s ABI is different from yours, some issues might pop up.
For example, when calling `SSL_library_init`, you would expect the return type to be `int`.
But in my infinite wisdom, when writing `bestc` I knew that all C functions that return int
in fact return `bool` and that `1` means success. So I did some "optimization" and all functions
returning `int` now actually return `char`.

It saves up on memory, so no harm done, right? ABI for my systems `libssl` now looks like
```c
uint8_t SSL_library_init(void);
```

...but for yours, it looks like:
```c
uint32_t SSL_library_init(void);
```

So when my `decrypt` dynamically links against your system's `libssl`, I expect `SSL_library_init();` to return a single byte:
```
0x01
```

But yours returns (assuming you are running a little endian system)
```
0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00
```

This still works! Some stack-smashing might occur, but we will leave that to the OS to figure out.

I then (somehow) successfully create a new `*SSL_ctx` and `*SSL` in `decrypt` and read from it using `my_cool_string`:
```c
my_cool_string *buf;
SSL_read(ssl, buf, buf->size);
```

`my_cool_string` is a `bestc` compiler construct that points to a dynamic `struct` that already includes
its `size` at the start and just moves the pointer at compile time over by the size `size_t`.
That's super cool and totally different from `std::basic_string` (`std::basic_string` is actually implemented extremely smart).

`SSL_read` is
```
int SSL_read(SSL *ssl, void *buf, int num);
```

`libssl` compiled using `bestc` of course works, because it moves the `*buf` over by 1
(`my_cool_string`s are max size 255 in `bestc`) but *your* `libssl` knows nothing about this bullshit,
so it just reads into the buffer and overwrites `my_cool_string.size`.

---

It might have started as a good analogy, but I got lost in creating my own compilers and structs.

Let's study a real(er) example: [PHP 7.4.19 and PHP 8.0.6 are 61.4% ABI compatible](https://abi-laboratory.pro/index.php?view=compat_report&l=php&v1=7.4.19&v2=8.0.6&obj=f3fdd&kind=abi).

This is understandable, since it's
a major release version, but still, if you used `libphp` (for some reason) and compiled a
piece of software that relied on `php_setcookie` function's parameters
`secure` `httponly` and `url_encode` being `int`s - well, they are now `_Bool`s (fancy Zend type) and thus shrunk
from 4 to 1 byte. Since `samesite` stayed `zend_string*`, the parameters will be misaligned on the call stack
and will lead to (in order of severity):

- `SEGFAULT` - will just crash (most likely in this case, since the pointer to `zend_string` will be corrupted)
- data corruption - self-explanatory
- undefined behaviour - something wierd will happen
- silent bug - something weird will happen `sometimes`, but it might work 99.9% of the time

Honestly, it is pretty hard to find *actual* critical and/or long-lasting ABI breakages since
[abi-laboratory.pro](https://abi-laboratory.pro)
seems to be serious and deliver on their project goals. Shutouts, kudos, thanks folks.


## FFI Magic

This post should not be about ABIs anyway - it should be about FFI in PHP!

`libffi`, which PHP uses for its FFI implementation tries to unify ABIs and provide
a "universal" ABI, which will most likely be compatible with the expected ABI.

Its most important function is in fact pretty simple,
```c
FFI_API
void ffi_call(ffi_cif *cif,
	      void (*fn)(void),
	      void *rvalue,
	      void **avalue);
```

Where `cif` is returned from `ffi_prep_cif`, `fn` is pointer to the function, `rvalue` is the return value
and `avalue` are the arguments. How to size the `struct`s and arguments properly is a painful process and
can be viewed in [`libffi` GitHub repository](https://github.com/libffi/libffi).

And indeed, much of the code there is about ABIs and how to find proper offsets, how to construct
function pointers properly etc.:
```
case X86_64_INTEGERSI_CLASS:
  /* Sign-extend integer arguments passed in general
     purpose registers, to cope with the fact that
     LLVM incorrectly assumes that this will be done
     (the x86-64 PS ABI does not specify this). */
```
[Link to code excerpt.](https://github.com/libffi/libffi/blob/8e3ef965c2d0015ed129a06d0f11f30c2120a413/src/x86/ffi64.c#L636-L640)

---

And of course, there are some remains of the calls made to `libffi` in PHP documentation and source, most notably today:
- [`FFI\CType::getFuncABI`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ffi-ctype.getfuncabi.php)

So if you ever wondered why is there a function with such a weird name and abbreviation, now you know why.


## Conclusion

It isn't necessary to know about ABIs, since `libffi` abstracts a lot of it away.

The key takeaways might be:
- If possible, compile ffi-libraries with the same compiler as PHP
- Do not use C++ interfaces with FFI
- If you require tightly-knit functionality with PHP you are probably better off writing an extension
- This is in no way an exact and detailed post about ABIs
