Why not use it? Could be fun, what are the pitfalls?

## What is FFI

<abbr title="Foreign Function Interface">FFI</abbr> is a mechanism which allows
developers to use C functions from shared libraries. Sounds simple, doesn't it?

Let's start exploring what is possible!


## Creating a Simple Library

Let's create a dumb library first. Let's call it `meddle`.

`libmeddle` provides two implementations for this function:

```c
/**
 * Increments the given int by
 * - 1  if called using C
 * - 10 if called using CPP
 * then returns it.
 */
int meddle(int);
```

A weird function to be sure, but I wanted to test possible incompatibilities
between C and CPP and ease of use with `stl`. I shall extend this in the future.

Nothing interesting in the library, the code can be viewed on the
<ViewPathOnGithub path='/php-ffi' commitHash='TODO'>sites GitHub.</ViewPathOnGithub>

Only thing we need to know for now is that I have installed it in `./c-lib/pfx/`.


## Enabling FFI in PHP

As per [Documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ffi.installation.php)
I need to `configure` with `--with-ffi`.
If you're using a prebuild binary, the vendor might have compiled it without
support for FFI. This can be found out using

```shell
php --info | grep "Configure Command" | grep -c ffi.
```

For me, the output is sadly
```
0
```
so my version wasn't build with FFI. Let's fix that by compiling PHP on our own.

1. [Get source](https://github.com/php/php-src/releases/tag/php-8.3.10)
2. `tar xvf` untar source
3. `./buildconf --force` build config
4. `./configure --with-ffi` and some other options, if required (I would recommend setting a different `--prefix`)
5. ``make -j`nproc` `` make
6. `make install` install
7. `./bin/php --info | grep "Configure Command" | grep -c ffi` now outputs `1`

I already had everything needed, you might need some libs, consult the php `README` if needed.

If you're running php using a provider/hosting and FFI is disabled, then you can ask them to enable it,
like for [Plesk](https://talk.plesk.com/threads/how-to-enable-ffi-extension-for-php7-4-fpm.362311/).

Finally, just whack `ffi.enable=true` at the end of `php.ini`.


## Testing Out

Let's test with a sample from Rasmus Lerdorf
```php
<?php
$ffi = FFI::cdef(
    "int printf(const char *format, ...);",
    "libc.so.6");
$ffi->printf("Hello %s!\n", "world");
```

```stdout
Hello world!
```

It seems to work!

## 3. Using our own libraries with FFI

Since we already have some headers, lets just simply load them! What could go wrong?

```php
<?php
$ffi_header = __DIR__ . '/c-lib/include/meddle.h';
$ffi = FFI::load($ffi_header);

echo "Hello world! " . $ffi->meddle(1);
```

Even before running, we might spy a small issue - how does FFI know which library to use?
Let's run it anyway:

```stdout
Fatal error: Uncaught FFI\ParserException: ';' expected, got '<STRING>' at line 5 in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php:9
Stack trace:
#0 /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php(9): FFI::load('/home/somrlik/S...')
#1 {main}

Next FFI\Exception: Failed loading '/home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/c-lib/include/meddle.h' in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php:9
Stack trace:

#1 {main}
  thrown in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php on line 9
```

OK, so we don't event parse the header. From the [documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ffi.load.php#:~:text=C%20preprocessor%20directives%20are%20not%20supported%2C%20i.e.%20%23include%2C%20%23define%20and%20CPP%20macros%20do%20not%20work%2C%20except%20for%20special%20cases%20listed%20below.):

> C preprocessor directives are not supported, i.e. #include, #define and CPP macros do not work,
> except for special cases listed below.

Wow, no `#include`, `#ifdef`, `#endif`? I guess we can live with it for now, so we just remove
the `extern "C"` compatibility magic. Let's go again I guess:

```stdout
Fatal error: Uncaught FFI\Exception: Failed resolving C function 'meddle' in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php:9
Stack trace:
#0 /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php(9): FFI::load('/home/somrlik/S...')
#1 {main}
  thrown in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php on line 9

```

Of course, we cannot resolve the function. But... how do we exactly do that? `FFI:load` only takes in
the path to a header file. As per the documentation:

> The header file may contain a #define statement for the `FFI_LIB` variable to specify the library it exposes.<br/>
> If it is a system library only the file name is required, e.g.: `#define FFI_LIB "libc.so.6"`.<br/>
> If it is a custom library, a relative path is required, e.g.: `#define FFI_LIB "./mylib.so"`.<br/>

Seems simple enough to add, although this exposes an issue - what if the headers and the library
are somewhere **completely** different? Furthermore, what if the system we are on supports multiple
versions of libraries being used, and we don't (or do) care about which one is used?

Side-note: some users on newer Macs might have had issues with some older software
requiring `openssl@1.1` which at some point got replaced with `openssl@3.0` with no warning
(no one reads Mac changelogs, prove me wrong).

For now, it seems that we need to provide the actual path to the library itself in the header.
Since I'm not installing this lib on my system (since it sucks), let's just add the path to
the header:

```c
#ifndef LIB_MEDDLE
#define LIB_MEDDLE

#define FFI_LIB ../lib/libmeddle-c.so

int meddle(int);

#endif
```

And let's try again:

```stdout
Fatal error: Uncaught FFI\Exception: Failed resolving C function 'meddle' in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php:9
Stack trace:
#0 /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php(9): FFI::load('/home/somrlik/S...')
#1 {main}
  thrown in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php on line 9

```

No dice. Wait a second, what did the documentation say?

> C preprocessor directives are not supported, i.e. #include, #define and CPP macros do not work

Oh, like they don't work *at all*. I need to remove them. Let's just create a new file, `meddle_ffi.h`:

```c
#define FFI_LIB "../lib/libmeddle-c.so"

int meddle(int);
```

Still no dice, but a better error:
```stdout
Fatal error: Uncaught FFI\Exception: Failed loading '/home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/c-lib/pfx/include/meddle_ffi.h', bad FFI_LIB define in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php:11
Stack trace:
#0 /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php(11): FFI::load('/home/somrlik/S...')
#1 {main}
  thrown in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php on line 11

```

I will now skip forward tens of minutes of debugging to tell you the answer:

> The path in `FFI_LIB` is relative to *current working directory* of the script.

Wait what?

So if I hypothetically wrote a composer package which included a C library, I would have to
make the headers different for every machine? Even worse, what if someone decided to
run the script from a different working directory? Or god knows, someone
might even *move* the library! Or the headers! Or they might even install them on their system!

Or maybe I would like to run my script under a web server, which inherently changes cwd.

> Relative paths just don't work for `FFI_LIB`. Don't try.

```pseudocode
$ ./run.php
CWD: /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments
Header: /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/c-lib/pfx/include/meddle_ffi.h
Hello world! 2
$ cd vendor
$ ../run.php
CWD: /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/vendor
Header: /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/c-lib/pfx/include/meddle_ffi.h

Fatal error: Uncaught FFI\Exception: Failed loading './c-lib/pfx/lib/libmeddle-c.so' (./c-lib/pfx/lib/libmeddle-c.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory) in /home/somrlik/Sites/ffi-experiments/run.php:12
Stack trace:

#1 {main}

```

So, what to do? `LD_PRELOAD` our library? Well, it works, when `FFI_LIB` is set to `"libmeddle-c.so"`.
Let's not meddle with this dark magic (for now).


## "Fixing" FFI Loading

My best guess is that someone just implemented the loading behavior using `dlopen()` and said good enough.

Let's write a simple wrapper around FFI loading. After some testing, this is what I came up with.
When you `load` a library:
- It creates a temporary header file
- Adds absolute `FFI_LIB` path
- Copies the original header
- `FFI:load`s the temp header

I am not using preloading or `FFI::scope` since there might be some issues waiting with these options,
but let's not get ahead of myself.

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Somrlik\FfiExperiments;

class FFILoader
{
	/** @var \FFI|null[] */
	private array $instances = [];

	public function load(string $name, string $header, string $library): bool {
		if (array_key_exists($name, $this->instances)) {
			return false;
		}

		$source = fopen($header, 'r+x');
		if ($source === false) return false;
		$temp = tmpfile();
		if ($temp === false) {
			fclose($source);
			return false;
		}

		$written = fwrite($temp, sprintf("#define FFI_LIB \"%s\"\n", $library));
		if (!$written) {
			fclose($temp);
			fclose($source);
			return false;
		}

		if (false === stream_copy_to_stream($source, $temp)) {
			fclose($temp);
			fclose($source);
			return false;
		}
		fclose($source);

		$oldCwd = getcwd();
		try {
			if (fflush($temp) === false) {
				return false;
			}
			$newCwd = dirname($library);

			if (chdir($newCwd) === false) {
				return false;
			}
			$ffi = \FFI::load(stream_get_meta_data($temp)['uri']);

			if ($ffi === null) return false;
			$this->instances[$name] = $ffi;
			return true;
		} finally {
			chdir($oldCwd);
			fclose($temp);
		}
	}

	public function get(string $name): \FFI|null {
		return $this->instances[$name] ?? null;
	}
}
```

And

```php
$ffiLoader = new FFILoader();
$ffiLoader->load('meddle-c', __DIR__ . '/c-lib/pfx/include/meddle_ffi.h', __DIR__ . '/c-lib/pfx/lib/libmeddle-c.so');
$ffiLoader->load('meddle-cpp', __DIR__ . '/c-lib/pfx/include/meddle_ffi.h', __DIR__ . '/c-lib/pfx/lib/libmeddle-cpp.so');

echo sprintf("Meddle from C: %d", $ffiLoader->get('meddle-c')->meddle(1)) . PHP_EOL;
echo sprintf("Meddle from CPP: %d", $ffiLoader->get('meddle-cpp')->meddle(1)) . PHP_EOL;
```

now works.

```stdout
Meddle from C: 2
Meddle from CPP: 11
```

## Conclusion

The first rodeo made me a bit skeptical.

Needing to write a separate header is fine and even understandable - there
would be so many issues with having to basically reimplement the whole preprocessor.
Let's not even think about the different declarations that might be dependent on platform (*foreshadowing*).

The system of determining which library should be chosen as the implementation of
the headers is ~not optimal~ fucking unusable. Still, it at least works for system-wide
libraries, just don't go around playing with the feature too much I guess.

Take care.
